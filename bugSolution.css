To fix this issue, ensure that the parent container has its width explicitly defined.  For example:

```css
.container {
  width: 100%; /* Or a specific pixel width */
}

div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

By setting the parent container's width to `100%` (or a fixed pixel value), you ensure that the child element's `width: 50%;` will correctly occupy 50% of the parent's available space.  Alternatively, if a flexible layout is desired, consider using flexbox or grid for better control over element sizing.
